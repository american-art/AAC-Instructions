1. **Karma Setup**

    Karma is used for mapping the data from different museum resources and integrating them using a shared ontology. 
    Instruction on downloading and setting up karma can be found on the [Karma Wiki](https://github.com/usc-isi-i2/Web-Karma/wiki). It also describes how data can be [transformed](https://github.com/usc-isi-i2/Web-Karma/wiki/Transforming-Data) and [mapped to an ontology](https://github.com/usc-isi-i2/Web-Karma/wiki/Modeling-Data)
